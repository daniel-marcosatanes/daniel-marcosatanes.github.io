Hi! I’m Daniel Marcos Atanes, a chemist fascinated by how molecules behave—and how we can shape their reactivity. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry at the University of Santiago de Compostela, working with Prof. José Luis Mascareñas on iridium-catalyzed C–H borylation. In short: I tweaked ligands to control where reactions happen on a molecule (very handy when building complex structures!).

My research brings together organic synthesis and computational chemistry, using both reaction flasks and theoretical tools to explore how non-covalent interactions drive selectivity. During my Ph.D., I spent time at CIC bioGUNE learning DFT and computational methods, and later joined the Hartwig group at UC Berkeley as a Fulbright fellow, where I explored supramolecular ligand design and polymer upcycling.

I’m drawn to projects that mix creativity with precision—especially those that challenge the way we think about catalysis and molecular design.
