Hi! I’m Daniel Marcos Atanes, a chemist fascinated by how molecules behave and how we can shape their reactivity. I recently wrapped up my Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry at the University of Santiago de Compostela under the supervision of prof. José Luis Mascareñas, where I worked on iridium-catalyzed C–H borylation—essentially tweaking ligands to control where reactions happen on a molecule (pretty useful if you're building complex things!).

My research bridges organic synthesis and computational chemistry, using both test tubes and theory to explore how non-covalent interactions influence selectivity. During my Ph.D., I had the chance to do research stays at CIC bioGUNE and UC Berkeley (in the Hartwig group), where I explored everything from supramolecular ligand design to polymer upcycling.
